# HumanFollowingRobot-ThermalCamera
In this project, the robot is carried out on an omni-directional robot platform.
The human fetection is using AdaFruit AMG8833 thermal camera.
Image processing will processed with single board computer Lattepanda.
The image taken from a thermal camera is in the form of a temperature values, then the values are converted into a thermography in RGB colorspace thus describes the temperature mapping.
The thermography will be processed using image processing on the single board computer lattepanda. This system is able to detect the target under various lightining condition
